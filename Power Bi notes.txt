FACT vs DIMENSION

FACT - Which we want to Analyse
	- If the col to be considered as a FACT we have 2 rules to satisfy

		- It has to be a Numeric col
		- When we do some aggregation like SUM it should give us some meaningful result.


DIMENSION - By which we want to analayse the FACT

Field wells - Here we need to drang the colsms/ fields to get a visual.

	- BAR Chart
		- X axis - Fact col / Numeric value
		- Y axis - Dim col
	- Col Chart
		- Y axis - Fact col / Numeric value
		- X axis - Dim col

Create the visuals

When we want to do some comparision betwwen FACT values better choose for any BAR / COL charts
	- Stacked bar chart
	- Clustered bar chart
	- Stacked col chart
	- Clustered col chart
	- 100% stacked bar chart
	- 100% stacked col chart.

31/05/2023

When we want to show the summarized data in the form of a visual
	- Table chart
		- This will have only 1 field well
		- This will help us in col wise totals only
	- Matrix chart
		- This is a pivot chart
		- Having 3 field wells
			- Rows
			- Colms
			- values
		- This helps in row and col wise totals.


What are the imp visuals which we need to be very clear

	- Stacked / clustured bar
	- Stacked / clustered col
	- Line chart
	- Pie chart / donut chart
	- Card
	- Slicer

How do you control your visual interactions ?
	- Select the visual from where you want to control other visuals
	- Click on format in the ribbon menu
	- Click on edit interactions
		- We will see some new options appering on top of each visual
		- Filter - This will filter the data and will disable the highlight interaction
		 Highlight - This is the default behaviour and will show the highlited part
		 None - This will stop the interaction itself.
	- Select the required type
	- Again click on edit interactions.

Drill down
		- When we want to see some hierarchy data we will use this option

Create hierarchy.

Power Pivot

		- Data Modelling / Dimensional Modelling
			- Creating a schema by giving relationships between FACT and DIM Table
		- Data Enhancement
			- Creating New information out of existing information
			- DAX
			- Data Analysis eXpressions

Data modelling
	- Creating relationships between fact and dim tables.

FACT Table
	- This table consists of all the FACT colms which we want to analyse
	- This will have all the foreign keys
	- In genral the fact table will have more no of rows

DIM Table
	- This consists of dim colms by which we want to analyse the facts
	- This will have the primary key
	- In genral the dim table will have less no of rows

Foreign key vs Primary key
	Foreign key - This will have atlest one duplicate value.
		    - This is used as a reference col to create the relationship with the primary key of the Dim table.

	Primary key - This key should consists if only unique values
			- No duplicates
			- No null values

Different types of cardinaliy
	- One to many
	- Many to one
	- One to one
	- Many to many

How to manage Many to Many relationships
	- We need to create a bridge table

When to use cross filter direction both ways
	- when the filtering is not towards to FACT table change the direction to both ways.

Different types of Data models
	- Star schema
		- 1 fact table and multiple dim tables
		- each dim table will be directly connected to the fact table.

	- Snow flake schema
		- 1 fact table and multiple dim tables
		- at least one dim table is indirectly connected to the fact table.

	- Galaxy schema / Hybrid schema.
		- More than 1 fact table
		- multiple dim tables.

Which schema is Faster ?
	- Star schema.

We created a model from scratch.

8/6/2023
DAX is the language used for Data enhancemnet
	- Data Analysis eXpressions.

What we create ?
	- measures
		- These are the aggregate values.
		- Does not consume memory
	- Calculated colms
		- When we need row wise calculations.
		- These will consume memory

Types of Measures
	- Implicit measures
	- Explicit measures

Merge queries vs Append Queries

Merge Queries is nothing but JOINS in SQL

1 common col / Matching col is required in both the Tables for merging.
LEFT JOIN - All records from Left Table and Matching records from Right Table.
Right JOIN - All records from Right Table and Matching records from Left Table.
INNER join - Only matching records from both the tables.
FULL join - All records from both the Tables.


Append Queries is nothing but UNION in SQL
The Table structure should be the same.
